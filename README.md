wisski_gnd_ap
===============

A simple wrapper that emulates an WissKI accesspoint for the GND of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek.
At the moment it does only support querying of entry metadata. Searching is currently not supported.

This module can be used as DNB doesn't provide its own SPARQL endpoint.
